      Using Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail#load" target="_blank">RAIL model</a>,
      we learn to focus on the more critical aspects of a page or component
      in order to improve the user's perception application speed. We define
      <strong>Time to Interactivity</strong> to be the time it takes for the user to perceive
      that the application is ready for interaction.

      Ember Interactivity allows us to generate latency metrics tailored to this definition;
      specifically, by identifying the critical components required to render a parent
      route or component, we can track load times and identify bottlenecks that are
      critical to the user experience. By focusing on perceived load times, we are
      able to reduce user bounce rates and churn through making the content appear to
      load faster. Some strategies for this involve adding placeholders for necessarily
      long content wait times, but often there is plenty of low-hanging fruit to make
      actual improvements if we have the proper instrumentation to locate these issues.
